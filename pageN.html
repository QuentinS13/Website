        our computer science skills to solve problems related to information systems.

            <img src="images/arbo.png" alt="Description de l'image">
            <p> <u>Program 2</u> : This function will allow us to count the number of lines and words in the
                file " file_name ". The function takes as input the file " file_name " which we suppose to exist and will return a list of two elements
                file and will return a list of two elements, the first of which is the number of lines, the second the number of
                number of words in the file.<br>
              <u>Program 3</u> : This function will allow us to count the lines and words in each of the files in the
              files in the list "list_files". The function will take as input a list of files " list_files " and return a list where each element is a list of two elements.
              and will return a list where each element is a list of two elements.<br>

              "file and will count the number of uses of each of these words.<br>

              of the files in the list " liste_fichiers " and will count the number of uses of each of these words 
              in each file.<br>
              <u>Program 6 :</u> This function will allow us to calculate the frequency of appearance of the 15 words

      <h3><b>Realization of the functionalities</b></h3>
      <h5>SAE
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>For the beginning of the SAE, I first started to create a tree structure using 
        the MKDIR function. This tree structure corresponds to the paths and files that will be useful for us 
        to realize this project. 
        Then, for the second function, I developed conditions to define a word. After having 
        opened the file, the program counts the lines until it has reached a certain character that we have defined. 
        defined. For the word counter, and for the lines, if the character is not in the list, we do 
        +1 to the counter in question.</p>
        
        <div class="additional-text-2" style="display:none;">
          <p>For function 3, we will open the files individually and then add them to a list 
            which will store all the files. 
            For the 4th function, we will use the notion "split" which will allow us to separate the 
            words. With " count ", we will count the number of words. <br>
            <p></p>
            For the 5th function, I had a lot of trouble, I can't explain it clearly.
            For the 6th function, we always start with the same process. We open our files, we read 
            line by line, and split each word with the "split" function. However, this time, we want the 
            15 most used words. So we initialize a max value variable to 0. Then, for all the elements 
            from 0 to 15, for the elements of the first list, if the element is not in the first list, 
            as well as if the element 1 is greater than or equal to the maximum value, then we put in a variable 
            word, the element 0, then in a frequency variable, we put the element 1, and the max value becomes 
            We add thanks to the "append" function, in our first list, and we reset our max value variable. 
            reinitialize our variable max value, by putting it at 0. And to finish, we add to the list of all our 
            files, the first list.<br>
            <p></p>
            In part 2, for exercise 1, I imported part 1 into part 2 because I needed 
            exercise 4, I also imported the library "matplotlib" to draw the graphs. For this 
            exercise, the use of the exercise 4 of the part 1 allows us to recover the word list. We 
            convert this list into a dictionary with the variable "dict".<br>
            <p></p>
            Then, our second function will allow us to count the 15 most frequent words. To 
            do this, I have created a word and frequency counter, with multiple lists to use. We will 
            then go through the list of words, and as long as the list is different from 15, we will add to the frequency counter 
            the value of the dictionary, and to the word counter, the key of the dictionary.<br>
            <p></p>
            Finally, we return a list of all the words, with a dictionary of the 15 most frequently used words. 
            frequently used words.
            In our 3rd function, we have to ask the user to enter a word. The function will go through
            the list of all files, and will open them individually. It separates each word, and then counts 
            the number of words.<br>
            <p></p>
            We add this result to the variable frequency, then in another list we add the word of the user, then the frequency of the word. 
            and then the frequency of the word. We convert the list into a dictionary in order to recover 
            the values of the keys and values of the dictionary to simplify our task when displaying 
            graphic display.<br>
            <p></p>
            For the 4th function, we list all the files again. Once again, we break down 
            all the words in each line, line by line, and then if we find a specific word, we add that line to a list 
            that line to a list called tweet. <br>
            <p></p>
            Next, we will add the words of the tweets in tweet_empty, for each element of the length of the list of all dates, we would create a list that will take the list of all dates. 
            length of the list of all dates, we create a list that will take the list of all dates, as well as 
            and the corresponding tweet.<br>
            <p></p>
            For the 5th function, we take up and modify the exercise 4, more precisely the part where we take all the dates.
            all the dates. Thanks to the "count" function, we will be able to count how many times we
            the same one in the list of all the dates. Then, for the dates in our date counter
            counter created before, if the dates are not in the date frequency counter, then we add the date to our
            date in our date frequency. Once again, we convert our date list into a dictionary
            and then create a graphical result.</p>
